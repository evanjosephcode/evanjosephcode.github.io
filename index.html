		<p> Hey to whomever is on my coding portfolio page, you've made it to the right place!</p>

		<p> I'm Evan, I'm from from the northeast-- Maryland specifically, went to college for business and got a degree in economics and marketing in the southeast-- at University of Miami, and have held numerous IT related positions for the past several years in Austin including consulting, sales/support, and administration roles, and have decided to dive head first into the wonderful world of coding. </p>
